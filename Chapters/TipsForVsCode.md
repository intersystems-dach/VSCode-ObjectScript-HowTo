## Editor Playground

If you just getting started with Visual Studio Code you can try the *Editor Playground* under `Help > Editor Playground`. Here you learn how to use some of the powerful [code editing features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).

## Use the Command Palette

The Command Palette is a powerful tool that allows you to access almost any feature or command in Visual Studio Code quickly and easily. Here you also can look up quickly the keybindings in case you forgt one. To open the Command Palette, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS).

## Use the Built-in Terminal

Visual Studio Code includes a built-in terminal that you can use to run command-line tools, such as git and npm. To open the terminal, press `Ctrl + Shift + Ö` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + Ö` (macOS).

## Use Code Snippets

Visual Studio Code includes a wide variety of built-in code snippets that can save you time when writing code. For example, you can type "for" and then press `Ctrl + Space` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Space` (macOS) to quickly create a for loop. You can also create your own custom code snippets by going to `File > Preferences > Configure User Snippets`.

## Customize the Theme

Visual Studio Code includes several built-in themes that you can use to customize the look and feel of the editor. You can change the theme by going to `File > Preferences > Color Theme`. To find more themes you can use the marketplace.

## Use Extensions

Visual Studio Code has a vast ecosystem of [extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) that add new features and functionality to the editor. You can browse and install extensions by going to `File > Extensions`. View [Essential visual Studio Code Extensions](EssentialExtensions.md).

## Learn the Keyboard Shortcuts

Visual Studio Code has a large number of keyboard shortcuts that can help you work faster and more efficiently. You can view the full list of keyboard shortcuts by going to `File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`, where you also can customize the keyboard shortcuts. View [Visual Studio Code Keyboard Shortcuts](KeyboardShortcuts.md).

## Customize the settings

Visual Studio Code allows you to customize various settings, such as the font size, tab size, and the number of spaces used for indentation. You can access these settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on a Mac). Here, you can edit the settings.json file, which contains all of your Visual Studio Code settings.

Here you can find useful settings as well as

- `editor.renderWhitespace`: render whitespaces in your code for better visibility.
- `editor.formatOnSave`: automatically format your code when you save the file
- `editor.tabSize`: customize the size of the tab
- `editor.fontSize` : customise the size of the font
